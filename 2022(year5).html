            <h1>Its our 5 year anniversary!ðŸŽ‰</h1>
            <p>Finally we started to be together more, as our classes were now offline. We used go together in bus, sit together. Ohh that year was full of romance. We used hold hands, i used rest my head on your shoulder. In class we used to touch our shoes. We had our own little moments. Even in bus when we had to sit apart we used listen to songs together. Our bond really grew. I used to come to your house and we cuddled. We had our first proper kiss. </p>
            <p>  I still remember, I kissed you and we were so lost in kiss. You got a call and I was startled but you calmly kissed me and took the call. When we cuddled for first time, I was so shy, I got all red, so I hided my face and you got scared thinking I was uncomfortable. You tried all the ways to make me feel comfortable. You kissed my forehead the whole time. You hugged me and asked me so many times If i am comfortable. That moment, I understood, You will never do anything that you make me uncomfortable. 
                <p> Even when teacher scolded me, You were there telling me and it was fine. You always motivated and supported me. Even I made mistakes and our teacher scolded me. You were ready to take the blame on you. I was so hurt and sad but you made sure that I was smiling and not sad. You made me laugh. And on our birthday when we were cutting the cake you secretly fed me a piece. It was really sweet. </p>
                <p>And when our trip went to Imagica. I was on my periods, You made sure that I am feeling fine. We clicked pictures. And that Water ride, I didnt wanted to go there. But it was best, you and I were sitting together. You promised me that I wont get wet. You covered me everytime you there was water splash. The camera there took our photos, they were so cute. I was all smiling looking at you. That was the one of the best trips with you. </p>
                <p>But, with ups, comes the downs too. In this year, we started to fight alot, We had many fights, sometimes, I was wrong. And sometimes you were wrong. We fought but still our bond got stronger. When people around were trying to break us, we stayed strong. 
                That makes our 2022 end. We had many things which we were new to. You got hurt, we fought but we also grew closer and stronger, It made sure we will never go apart. Now we had come to the end of this year. See you soon in year 2023. Until then, Byee my babyy, I lovee youuu so so much!!! thank you for making me realize you will always be there and Always be a gentleman and best boyfriend. I really love you so much!</p>
