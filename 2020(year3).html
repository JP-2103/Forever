            <h1>Covid and us!!ðŸ˜¥</h1>
            <p>This year is going to be hard one! Well its been ages honestly just 1-2months but still feels so much time has passed I havent talked to you. I hadnt even thought that this would be so hard. Just in feb we were joking about covid. Now it has become a huge problem. And even we have been growing a little apart, I feel. We can't talk properly or see each other, its just making everything difficult.I hope everything gets back normal. This is the last year of our school life and now only we have started to grow close, why this distance? I really want us to be together. I dont know what will happen to us my love! But you know now online classes have started so guess this will help us in talking ha...Do you remember we had our first video call on snapchat. </p>
            <p>Finally now the lockdown is over! I can finally see you. School has started again. When I saw you with your new look and hairstyle you were just as handsome as you are now. Looking at you talking to you just being around made me so happy. To be honest with you, This lockdown just taught us no matter ho much it is difficulties come, we will stay together..right? It wasnt to love you when i had no contact with you for 1-2months but still I know you will be there forever. But this wasnt it. We even went together to trip in feb right? Where will held hands in bus. We even had our own way to romance just with eyes. That soft love had different fun and excitment right babyyy? This puppy love stage was just starting, we have so much to go ahead. Well 3 years together is a big thing. And i feel really happy about it. I know I have found the right guy who will stay with me forever! I will marry you my love!</p> 
            <p>Now, we have come to end of this year mister!! This year was full of rollercoaster, romance and distance everything still we survived at huge obstacle. Now its time to end this year's letter. See you soon in 2021 my love! Untilthen I love you so so much my babyyyy!!! This year, next year every year I love you more and more. I will write you these letters every year!I just want to be with you and marry you so that our childern can know much we love each other! I want whole world to know how much we love each other. Okay okay i will go now, see you in next year okay! wait for my letter until then. So many letters are on your way. At the first night of the marriage, I want to see a box filled with this letters babyy!! keep them safe!!
