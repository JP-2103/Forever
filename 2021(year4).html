            <h1>We met each other after one year finally!üòÅ</h1>
            <p>Seeing you after an year, All grown taller and your long hairs so good. Well I was really happy to see
                you. But I could not sit near you hold your hand, Still we had our eye contacts and leg touching while
                standing in line. All really changed after covid right. The school where we had so many moments was now
                going to end and we could not even be together. Also looking at you staring at you but I could not hold
                your hand, touch you. It was very difficult. </p>
            <p> Soon our school ended. Boards got cancelled. You told me that boards will not be there and I was
                stressing over them. You predicted that so well. I believed you and made bets with my friends. After
                that we did not really got any chance to meet. But, then came our farewell and that too on your
                birthday. Oh! finally I can be with you and spend some time. We even clicked photos. And how can I
                forget about your birthday gift ha. You remember we went upstairs and I surprised you saying here is
                your birthday gift close your eyes, and kissed you on your lips. You were so shy and you cant even look
                at me in my eyes. You looked so cute. We sat for moment and talked. I asked you about my dress, Ofc I
                complained saying everyone wore short dress and Only I wore this long gown, Is it looking too much. And
                as always you said, "No you are looking so cute, You are looking so royal like a princess in this. I
                loved it" and I smiled. As the year went by. We didnt really meet so much. But you communicated daily.
                Talking about everything we can. </p>
            <p> Then there came tension of choosing college for 11th 12th. We both choose science but You told you
                choose the classes also. I wanted to be with you. So I tried so hard to get that class convinced my mom
                and dad. Finally, we were in same class. Tho classes were online we were still together. </p>
            <p> That year was really filled with ups and downs but still we had our own little happy moments. We
                experinced so many new things. Our bond got stronger from this year. We were more mature and started to
                understand each other more from this year. </p>
            <p>Well that was it in this year. See you soon in next year my Love!!! until then, Byee my love I really
                love you so much. Thank you for staying with me always, and loving me so much. </p>
            </p>
