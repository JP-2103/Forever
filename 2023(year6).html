            <h1>6 years time flies so fast with you!ðŸ’ž</h1>
            <p>This year, we had our boards, You scored so well, both in Entrance as well as boards. I am really happy for you. Even though my marks werent so good. But your scores made me so happy. Our romance during board exams and practicals. We used to wait for each other, and that little talks were so cute were'nt they? You remember baby, our farewell, You were with me, You complimented me so much. We clicked photos. I was so shy that time. We went to eat ice cream everyone was there. And you sat next to me and made me fed you ice cream. You always made sure I went home safely.  </p>
            <p> Soon I started to feel sad and pressured as my scores werent well to go to my dream college. And family pressure to do engineering was making my mental health so bad. I used to be sad all time which even affect our relationship. But you didnt say anything and always made sure I would feel better. You listened to everything I used to say even though sometimes I said hurtful things. Wen I look back, 2022 and 2023 was only good because I had you. Otherwise all other things were messed up.  </p>
            <p> Anyways, Finally I took engineering and a integrated program. We  had to choose different colleges. As you were doing business and I was choosing engineering. I had to go to hostel. Distance was making it hard but we used to talk daily. Things were so new to us, but slowly we got used to them and eventually our fights were now less. When we looked at other couples, We felt happy as we got right partner at right time. Even though, our feilds were different we still used to study together. </p> 
            <p>  We went on our first date after 5 years, isnt that crazy. We went out in bus, we eat momos because I was craving for it. We held hands and roam around. We went on more dates after that. We also played garba together. </p>
            <p> We used to talk on calls, meet. We grew more stronger. We gossiped about everything. Everytime I was coming back home you always made sure I reach safely. Even though you were far but still protected me and made sure I was okay and happy.  </p>
            <p> Soon this year came to end, making sure we were stronger, and very sure that everything would be alright as long as we have each other. We had so many new experinces, We got to know that love and romance not only meant to be together physically near each other. But being connected and attached. Keeping each other as priorities. Giving each other little updates and ending the day with talking to each other about how our day was. </p> 
            <p>  Well, We have come to end now. See you year 2024 my love. Until then, byee byee my love, I loveee youuu soooo muchhh. Thank you for making me understand how important I am to you. Thank you for always making sure I was growing becoming a better and happier person. Thank you for always staying by my side.</p>
