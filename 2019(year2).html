            <h1>We made it to second year.YAY!!!ðŸ¥³</h1>
            <p>We completed one year together!! Can you believe it??? So, 2019 will be the most innocent love wala year, And we tried so many new things. Do you remember my first visit at your home. Our first hug, first time holding hands. It was hindi lecture and as usual you were teasing me by throwing paper from below so i also took my chance and held your hand. YOur hands were always perfect temperature, cold when i was feeling hot and warm when i was feeling cold. Then came the time when we had to give 10th farewell. when clicked so many pics on terrace and you back hugged me for first time.And when we used to practice in different class you used to peak through that small window and wave your hand with smile whenever I looked at you. And that was the year when you got close with geet.I was so jealous but i was confident too. So it didnt really matter. She used to always try to get close to you and you being idiot, you always be behind me. You used to never miss a chance to sit with me. And ofc how can i forget your cute habit of giving the half of the chocolate you got on birthdays. You stole from your friends ha! At the age where you saw people breaking up from their 1-2months relationship, We stayed together for whole damn year knowing we have to stay so for whole our lives.I still remember how i used to snuck my grandpa's phone to talk to you. We used to walk to our buses together. All lectures looking at each other holding hands.It was one of the sweetest time. By this time, even seniors and juniors got to know about us. What can i say more on how popular you were ha. I was shy girl while you had your friends everywhere.It was nice cause i could hear all the gossips right.<br><br> Thank you my love, Thank you for staying with me throughout 2019. Thank you for sticking around. Thank you for standing up for me. Thank you for choosing me, even when people told you to leave me. 2019 was sweetest year with you by me. I got to know that you will stay with me not only for one year but all my lives.In every life the man i will fall in love and marry is you. I was happiest whenever i was with you. My smiles were genuine with you.Everytime you showed me how gentleman you are. Thank you for my love for making my 2019 memorable.  </p>
