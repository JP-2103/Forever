            <h1>OUR FIRST YEAR!ðŸ˜Š</h1>
            <p>Finally you said it! On 21st April 2018 at 3:30pm, Your message popped on the phone. You said you were sorry because i was teased by your friend for saying you love me. Well you told my 'ILY' which dumb me didnt understand. You explained me what it means but before that you told me to write ILY (your name)! i wrote and then I called you brother! hahahaðŸ˜‚. You said 'dont call me brother please!' and i told you not to joke prank around. You called me saying 'please believe kar na' (That was our first call. can you believe it! It was just for 5secs max. but that call definately knew that there were going to be more long calls where even 1 hour would feel like 5secs.)And continuing further I told you to give me time. Infact i couldnt wait to give you answer.I answered you 'Yes!'. I know you will say you were confident enough I will say yes. Well i am happy that someone has confidence on me. <Br> On the next day it was just so awkward in class we didnt even look at each other. Months went by and we used to give each other little dares of just touching each others hand. how childish we were right.It was cute right.Gradually we started opening up and My condition of not telling anyone just flopped. Everyone knew about us even seniors and juniors but i was so in love with you at that time that there was no breaking up written for us. <br> Now, here are my favourites moments of 2018, Your letter has to be there, it was you who wrote the first ever letter with so much love and cuteness. I could not help but read it more than twice. then comes seat changing.. how you used to change your seats just to sit somewhere near me.And  how can I forget the times when we had our little romantics moments which may have seemed to be little but still hard to forget like when we used to stare at each other when other one was not looking. When we used to tease each other with our names. When we used to chat for hours. When we first met at your home talked so many things like i hugged you and layed my head on your shoulder oh it was so peaceful, It is the safest place in our world after my father's hug. <br><br>This brings our 2018 to end with alot of new experinces and most important we found our forever home. It was sweetest and most memorable year, where you seemed to be more handsome, more gentle, more cuter and little dumb. </p>
